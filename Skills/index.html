              I&#39;m a UX researcher with a deeply empathetic approach to user research. I use surveys, interviews,
              usability testing, and ethnographic observation to gather data and digital tools like Google Analytics and
              A/B testing platforms to analyze user behavior. My strengths include synthesizing research data,
              translating findings into actionable recommendations, and effectively communicating my findings to
              stakeholders.

              My approach to user empathy involves a deep dive into their world through methods such as interviews and
              ethnographic observation. For example, while working on an e-commerce platform, I discovered users felt
              overwhelmed by the amount of product options and lacked personalized recommendations. To address these
              issues, I designed a recommendation system using machine learning and simplified the interface. I use
              tools like persona creation and have a background in human-centered design principles and design thinking
              methodologies. Overall, I&#39;m committed to understanding user needs and using those insights to design
              products that truly meet them.

            <p class="my-approach-to-quali my-approach-to kurale-normal-black-32px">
              My approach to qualitative interviews involves building rapport with users and asking open-ended questions
              that encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences. For example, while working on a travel app, I
              asked users open-ended questions like &#34;Can you describe a time when you had a negative experience
              booking a trip?&#34; to gain insights into their needs and pain points. I listen actively and use
              follow-up questions to uncover hidden insights that may not have surfaced with closed-ended questions.
              Overall, my commitment to understanding user experiences and perspectives shapes my approach to
              qualitative interviews.
