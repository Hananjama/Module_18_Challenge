        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I'm a UX researcher with a deeply empathetic approach to user research. I use surveys, interviews, usability testing, and ethnographic observation to gather data and digital tools like Google Analytics and A/B testing platforms to analyze user behavior. My strengths include synthesizing research data, translating findings into actionable recommendations, and effectively communicating my findings to stakeholders.</p>

        <h3>User Empathy</h3>
        <p>My approach to user empathy involves a deep dive into their world through methods such as interviews and ethnographic observation. For example, while working on an e-commerce platform, I discovered users felt overwhelmed by the amount of product options and lacked personalized recommendations. To address these issues, I designed a recommendation system using machine learning and simplified the interface. I use tools like persona creation and have a background in human-centered design principles and design thinking methodologies. Overall, I'm committed to understanding user needs and using those insights to design products that truly meet them.</p>

        <h3>Qualitative research</h3>
        <p>My approach to qualitative interviews involves building rapport with users and asking open-ended questions that encourage them to share their thoughts and experiences. For example, while working on a travel app, I asked users open-ended questions like "Can you describe a time when you had a negative experience booking a trip?" to gain insights into their needs and pain points. I listen actively and use follow-up questions to uncover hidden insights that may not have surfaced with closed-ended questions. Overall, my commitment to understanding user experiences and perspectives shapes my approach to qualitative interviews.</p>
